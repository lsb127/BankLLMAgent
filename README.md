# BankLLMAgent - Educational Vulnerable Banking System

🏦 **CMPT782 Security Lab - VulnBank**

A deliberately vulnerable banking system designed for cybersecurity education and training. This project demonstrates common security vulnerabilities in web applications and AI-powered systems.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**THIS SYSTEM IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**

- Contains **INTENTIONAL** security vulnerabilities
- **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**
- Designed for cybersecurity training and research
- Use only in isolated, controlled environments

## 🎯 Project Overview

BankLLMAgent is a comprehensive educational platform that simulates a banking system with multiple attack vectors:

- **Vulnerable REST API** with SQL injection, authentication bypasses, and data exposure
- **AI-Powered Chatbot** with prompt injection and jailbreak vulnerabilities
- **Web Interface** built with Streamlit for interactive testing
- **SQLite Database** with intentionally weak security practices
